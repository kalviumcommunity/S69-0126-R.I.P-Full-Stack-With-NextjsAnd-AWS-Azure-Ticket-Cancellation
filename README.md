# Ticket Cancellation – Transparent Bus Ticket Cancellation & Refund Tracking System

## Project Overview

Intercity bus ticket cancellations and refunds are often opaque and inconsistent. Passengers face unclear cancellation rules, unpredictable refund timelines, and limited visibility into refund status. This lack of transparency reduces trust and creates accountability gaps between passengers, operators, and platforms.

This project aims to build a **transparent and predictable ticket cancellation and refund tracking system** that clearly explains refund rules, timelines, and status to users.

This repository currently contains a **basic Next.js setup**, which will be expanded in future sprints.
